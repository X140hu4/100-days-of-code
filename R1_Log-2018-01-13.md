# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Fabien

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [, Monday, 2017].

### Day 001: January 15, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1.[geckos-26] Merged candy's card moving branch. Closed PR and deleted branch.

**Thoughts**
It is a big mess when there are conflicts... I had to loose the props in the subcomponents Lists and Cards.
Also capitalization on file name seems to throw github off when making comparisons between files... So defintely need to be all aligned on no capitalization in name file, and no spaces.
