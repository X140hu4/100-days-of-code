# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Fabien

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 15, Monday, 2017].

### Day 002: January 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1.[geckos-26] Worked on create route for new list

**Thoughts**
[Geckos] Issues encountered trying to pass data around for Create List:
- Get data from the form: Used ref on the input field
- Access ref from parent component: pass 'hook' via props to the child to assign value to variable in parent
- post a json request: added a header specifying content-type to be json and assigned JSON.stringify(data) to the body.
Used the article ["CRUD in React and Express (MySQL)"](https://medium.com/@avanthikameenakshi/crud-react-express-99025f03f06e) to kickstart working on fetch post.

### Day 001: January 15, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1.[geckos-26] Merged candy's card moving branch. Closed PR and deleted branch.

**Thoughts**
It is a big mess when there are conflicts... I had to loose the props in the subcomponents Lists and Cards.
Also capitalization on file name seems to throw github off when making comparisons between files... So defintely need to be all aligned on no capitalization in name file, and no spaces.
