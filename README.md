### Day 026: February 09, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Tic Tac Toe: Working on AI with minimax algorithm

**Thoughts**
The computer function was returning undefined because there was no return from the function. The function was called recursively.

### Day 023: February 06, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Pomodoro: Finished project

**Thoughts**
- Nested conditionals to get correct length value (break, break lg or session). 
- Logics for the maxtime value from which is determined the width of the progress bar.
- The code to change the color of the progress bar induced a Bug with val and width when finishing a session.
- Solved the bug. The timerVal kept the previous value because it was outside the scope. 
- Implemented toggleDisplay function (save a few lines and a lot of characters)
- Corrected the timer clock that was not at the bottom of the box (reason: scope of the flexbox)
- Reset logics and styled UI element
- Styled footer.
- CSS cleanup and comment

### Day 021: February 04, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Pomodoro: Finished most of the design

**Thoughts**
Had kanji kentei test at 1:30 and finished at 2:40. Went for macdonalds before going to the Brooklyn coffee to work on the pomodoro project.
Worked 5 pomodoros on:
- Refactoring the increaseValue and decraseValue into a unique changeValue function 
- Worked on the progress background in the timer pane. Originally tried with linear-gradient but gradient wouldn't provide a clear demarcation of progress. 
- Used a parent element for the progress bar. Changing the width percentage to show the progress. It makes the progress function also simplier.
- Decided not to use rounded corners as it was hard to manage with the progress bar parent element. The border-radius would be relative to the width of the element, the width starting at 0 and enlarging with time, the borders would overflow the box's borders. Having right angles makes things easier to manage.

### Day 018: February 01, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Pomodoro: Continue designing
2. [Codewars] Completed 6 kyu Kata "Perfect Square"

**Thoughts**
Getting a better idea of how to use flexbox and grid to style effectively the different elements without heavily relying on position relative, margins and paddings. However I don't take into account capabilities for responsiveness, I would like to get a good working grasp of positioning properties before pursuing responsiveness with these techniques.

### Day 017: January 31, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Pomodoro: Design search, Wireframe, styling

**Thoughts**
The logics being well advanced, I decided to start making the UI. First, I opened all the website I had for design inspiration in my bookmarks. I found a few nice design and picked a few design concepts I liked. I am going with a landing view to define the settings then start the pomodoro. The pomodoro will then have a bar that will change color/fill with another color as time passes by. I started styling the landing page.

### Day 016: January 30, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Pomodoro: Pause, continue and automatic switch

**Thoughts**
The problem of clearInterval was because of it being declared in the toggle function. I have to be careful of scopes. When designing the automatic switch function with recursion, the management of switch variables caused issues as one was reset at the begining of a new toggle call.

**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Made the design for the JS Calculator

**Thoughts**
- [fCC] Started the JS calculator project. 
- Started trying with flexbox but it was hard to spread the divs of the input panel equally. [Flexbox free course](https://scrimba.com/g/gflexbox)
- Used CSS grid to space the different elements, in particular the input panel. [Grid free course](https://scrimba.com/c/cbVn4t4)

### Day 009: January 23, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [Portfolio] Worked on portfolio's sections

**Thoughts**
- [Portfolio] Made a hero section, populated and styled it. Found a trick for the internal link from navbar to section of the page. The problem was that when clicking on "My work", the page would go below the Portfolio header. The trick I found and was satisfied with was to have a `<a></a>` tag with a class of anchor with certain properties, including an negative vertical offset.
Added the about section, work in progress. I would need to add the skills section too at some point but I had some issues with the logos having different sizes... I think I would need to resize them first for the screen size and file size so that they don't use too much data on load.

### Day 003: January 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [geckos-26] Finished CRUD routes
2. [Portfolio] Finished initial wireframing

**Thoughts**
- [Geckos] Issues encountered:
    - Delete route: I wanted to delete the list but also the related cards. The cards' ids are in a cards property of List. I needed to get the list first, then get the cards array and iterate through the cards and delete them. Once the cards are delete the list is deleted. When the cards are deleted their reference in the cards array of list are not.
- [Portfolio] Finished initial wireframing for a one page page. Another idea would be to have the body show only the part selected in the navbar instead of having everything available to scroll?

### Day 002: January 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [geckos-26] Worked on create route for new list
2. [Portfolio] Used Evolus Pencil to start wireframing the portfolio site

**Thoughts**

- [Geckos] Issues encountered trying to pass data around for Create List:
    - Get data from the form: Used ref on the input field
    - Access ref from parent component: pass 'hook' via props to the child to assign value to variable in parent
    - post a json request: added a header specifying content-type to be json and assigned JSON.stringify(data) to the body.
Used the article ["CRUD in React and Express (MySQL)"](https://medium.com/@avanthikameenakshi/crud-react-express-99025f03f06e) to kickstart working on fetch post.
[Portfolio] Hands on pencil to start wireframing the portfolio.

### Day 001: January 15, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [geckos-26] Merged candy's card moving branch. Closed PR and deleted branch.

**Thoughts**

It is a big mess when there are conflicts... I had to loose the props in the subcomponents Lists and Cards.
Also capitalization on file name seems to throw github off when making comparisons between files... So defintely need to be all aligned on no capitalization in name file, and no spaces.
