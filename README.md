### Day 000: January 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Started Pomodoro project
2. [Portfolio] Contact form, languages and scrollspy

**Thoughts**
[fCC] 
- Started pomodoro project
- Manage length of session and break
- Countdown functionality started

[Portfolio]
- Made the contact form work with formspree. Since the submit form was outside the form element, I had to add a JS code to perform the submit on click.
- Translated the portfolio to French and Japanese
- Added a scrollspy functionality when clicking on an internal link or scrolling the page.
