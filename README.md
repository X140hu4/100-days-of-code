# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Fabien

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 15, Monday, 2017].

### Day 019: February 02, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Pomodoro: Continue designing

**Thoughts**
Had an afternoon shift at work and didn't have the mental energy to do much. Spent one pomodoro on styling the left side of the timer-container.

### Day 018: February 01, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Pomodoro: Continue designing
2. [Codewars] Completed 6 kyu Kata "Perfect Square"

**Thoughts**
Getting a better idea of how to use flexbox and grid to style effectively the different elements without heavily relying on position relative, margins and paddings. However I don't take into account capabilities for responsiveness, I would like to get a good working grasp of positioning properties before pursuing responsiveness with these techniques.

### Day 017: January 31, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Pomodoro: Design search, Wireframe, styling

**Thoughts**
The logics being well advanced, I decided to start making the UI. First, I opened all the website I had for design inspiration in my bookmarks. I found a few nice design and picked a few design concepts I liked. I am going with a landing view to define the settings then start the pomodoro. The pomodoro will then have a bar that will change color/fill with another color as time passes by. I started styling the landing page.

### Day 016: January 30, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Pomodoro: Pause, continue and automatic switch

**Thoughts**
The problem of clearInterval was because of it being declared in the toggle function. I have to be careful of scopes. When designing the automatic switch function with recursion, the management of switch variables caused issues as one was reset at the begining of a new toggle call.

### Day 015: January 29, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [Portfolio] Tested website with w3C markup validation and Google speed test

**Thoughts**
There are improvements to make with the image sizes. They load fast enough but they could take less space in memory.

### Day 014: January 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts**
[fCC] 
- Started pomodoro project

- Added a scrollspy functionality when clicking on an internal link or scrolling the page.

### Day 010: January 24, 2018
**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts**
- [Portfolio] Finished a first version of the portfolio in English. The contact form is missing its functionality but I couldn't make it work to make a post request.

### Day 009: January 23, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [Portfolio] Worked on portfolio's sections

**Thoughts**
- [Portfolio] Made a hero section, populated and styled it. Found a trick for the internal link from navbar to section of the page. The problem was that when clicking on "My work", the page would go below the Portfolio header. The trick I found and was satisfied with was to have a `<a></a>` tag with a class of anchor with certain properties, including an negative vertical offset.
Added the about section, work in progress. I would need to add the skills section too at some point but I had some issues with the logos having different sizes... I think I would need to resize them first for the screen size and file size so that they don't use too much data on load.

1. [Portfolio] Worked on portfolio's
2. [fCC] Helped campers on gitter and fCC's forum

**Thoughts**
- [Portfolio] I had some trouble with the different navbars and how they should be nested. Managed to get a basic navbar with all the elements I wanted and responsiveness thanks to bootstrap 4.

### Day 003: January 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [geckos-26] Finished CRUD routes
2. [Portfolio] Finished initial wireframing

**Thoughts**
- [Geckos] Issues encountered:
    - Delete route: I wanted to delete the list but also the related cards. The cards' ids are in a cards property of List. I needed to get the list first, then get the cards array and iterate through the cards and delete them. Once the cards are delete the list is deleted. When the cards are deleted their reference in the cards array of list are not.
- [Portfolio] Finished initial wireframing for a one page page. Another idea would be to have the body show only the part selected in the navbar instead of having everything available to scroll?

### Day 002: January 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [geckos-26] Worked on create route for new list
2. [Portfolio] Used Evolus Pencil to start wireframing the portfolio site

**Thoughts**

- [Geckos] Issues encountered trying to pass data around for Create List:
    - Get data from the form: Used ref on the input field
    - Access ref from parent component: pass 'hook' via props to the child to assign value to variable in parent
    - post a json request: added a header specifying content-type to be json and assigned JSON.stringify(data) to the body.
Used the article ["CRUD in React and Express (MySQL)"](https://medium.com/@avanthikameenakshi/crud-react-express-99025f03f06e) to kickstart working on fetch post.
[Portfolio] Hands on pencil to start wireframing the portfolio.

### Day 001: January 15, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [geckos-26] Merged candy's card moving branch. Closed PR and deleted branch.

**Thoughts**

It is a big mess when there are conflicts... I had to loose the props in the subcomponents Lists and Cards.
Also capitalization on file name seems to throw github off when making comparisons between files... So defintely need to be all aligned on no capitalization in name file, and no spaces.
