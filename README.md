# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Fabien

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 29, Tuesday, 2018].


### Day 001: August 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Working on 2D Array - DS
2. [freeCodeCamp] Worked 30 mins on the Applied Accessibility section

**Thoughts**
What is the *2D Array - DS* about? The challenge is about calculating the highest score of a pattern (an hourglass) from a square grid of 6x6 values. I originally used a variable to store the highest value but it didn't pass two tests. I changed it to store each calculated value to an array and then finally return the result. The result was written using a spread operator with the array as the argument of the Math.max() function. This change allowed the code to pass all the tests. 

fCC's applied accessibility section:
 - Learned about the importance of semantic HTML
 - Learned about the difference between article (self-contained independent content), section (related content) and div (group content)
 - Time standardization with `<date></date>`
 - Audio and form accessibility

### Day 000: January 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Started Pomodoro project
2. [Portfolio] Contact form, languages and scrollspy

**Thoughts**
[fCC] 
- Started pomodoro project
- Manage length of session and break
- Countdown functionality started

[Portfolio]
- Made the contact form work with formspree. Since the submit form was outside the form element, I had to add a JS code to perform the submit on click.
- Translated the portfolio to French and Japanese
- Added a scrollspy functionality when clicking on an internal link or scrolling the page.
