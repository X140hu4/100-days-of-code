# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Fabien

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 29, Tuesday, 2018].


### Day 004 August 14, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Worked on 4 - Insert a Node at the Tail of a Linked List
2. [freeCodeCamp] Started working on the form project

**Thoughts**:
Worked on inserting a node into a linked list. I have trouble creating the full list, I am missing something here... Probably in the object I return from the function.

Started working on the survey form project from the fCC curriculum. I only put the different elements and ids necessary to pass the tests at the moment. Still thinking about the theme of the form.

### Day 003 August 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [freeCodeCamp] Worked 30 mins on the Flexbox challenges and CSS Grid.

**Thoughts**:
Hit the end of the Responsive Web Design section. I am thinking about making a tribute page to Jean Luc Picard with the LCARS (star trek OS) inspired by this website: http://www.lcarscom.net/. Show a loader and then show the profile of the captain as seen on [personel file in TNG](https://www.google.com/search?q=jean+luc+picard+personnel+file&hl=en&safe=off&tbm=isch&tbs=rimg:CVNy-_1zUSVjxIjjGMkipba9YzoxkXKRhFH1GHIgcyYSVYCVEWW2h-yNZHlfg2vUC7Eo7Qi6tRvyjxBihRkGyMYUOYSoSCcYySKltr1jOEQI_1jU4F6ngxKhIJjGRcpGEUfUYRSLNdl2KgrhEqEgkciBzJhJVgJRG1k5m0C3tf1SoSCURZbaH7I1keEdcHWNAhNdORKhIJV-Da9QLsSjsRNDmkQdDJx04qEglCLq1G_1KPEGBHqWguViTz0tioSCaFGQbIxhQ5hEdcHWNAhNdOR&tbo=u&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwisirn01-jcAhUJZt4KHeMFDfwQ9C96BAgBEBs&biw=1707&bih=852&dpr=1.13)

### Day 002: August 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Completed 3 - Print the Elements of a Linked List
2. [freeCodeCamp] Worked 30 mins on the Applied Accessibility, responsive Web Design Principles and CSS Flexbox section

**Thoughts**
Today's JS prep challenge was easy considering I have encountered linkedlist in CS50 last year in C. In JS, two class are declared as constant to create the Singly Linked List and the Linked List's nodes. The node object has two values: data and next, data containing the data and next the next node object (and its own nodes). The list object also has two values: head and tail and a method insertNode. The insertNode initialize the list with the first nodeData then sets the tail value to the node.

The responsive we design principles was quick and felt a bit weak in the content. Started CSS flexbox, it is a good way of reviewing that.

### Day 001: August 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Working on 2D Array - DS
2. [freeCodeCamp] Worked 30 mins on the Applied Accessibility section

**Thoughts**
What is the *2D Array - DS* about? The challenge is about calculating the highest score of a pattern (an hourglass) from a square grid of 6x6 values. I originally used a variable to store the highest value but it didn't pass two tests. I changed it to store each calculated value to an array and then finally return the result. The result was written using a spread operator with the array as the argument of the Math.max() function. This change allowed the code to pass all the tests.    

fCC's applied accessibility section:
 - Learned about the importance of semantic HTML
 - Learned about the difference between article (self-contained independent content), section (related content) and div (group content)
 - Time standardization with `<date></date>`
 - Audio and form accessibility

### Day 000: January 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Started Pomodoro project
2. [Portfolio] Contact form, languages and scrollspy

**Thoughts**
[fCC] 
- Started pomodoro project
- Manage length of session and break
- Countdown functionality started

[Portfolio]
- Made the contact form work with formspree. Since the submit form was outside the form element, I had to add a JS code to perform the submit on click.
- Translated the portfolio to French and Japanese
- Added a scrollspy functionality when clicking on an internal link or scrolling the page.
