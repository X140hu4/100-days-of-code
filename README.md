Learned a great deal about aggregate and pipeline for mongodb. Unfortunately I don't have enough time to finish the three chapters before the deadline.

### Day 017 August 27, 2018
**Thoughts**:
Reviewed Javascript on fCC and started a mongoDB course M121 MongoDB Aggregation framework course.
Also had to quickly learn a bit of C# while answering questions for a job application. Applied for a few other jobs. It seems there are more graduate/junior job offers getting out there at the moment, probably because the end of the academic year is closing in.

### Day 016 August 26, 2018
**Thoughts**:
No progress today. Mostly worked on polishing new cover letters for dev and non-dev positions.
I think I will start working 30 mins everyday on progressing on the fCC curriculum to get the machine going, otherwise I am just going to continue procrastinate on the projects...

I couldn't find a free stock video of donuts so I decide to go with Cookies, I could call the page The Cookie Dough company that offers three types of cookies: regular, white choc and dark black choc.


### Day 012 August 22, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [Job Search] Interview with Charles Wheeler (The Digital Store)
2. [PHP] Followed PHP course from freecodecamp

**Thoughts**:
Got an interview at a recruite company. All in all seemed good, I will see what job opportunities they come up with.
I watched about 2h30 worth of PHP course from freeCodeCamp. There are a lot of common things with javascript so far. I stopped at about 80% talking about class and objects.

### Day 011 August 21, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
Skip day. I will allow 10 skip day maximum over the challenge. I did apply to a job at Vend, they asked a lot of questions so it took me some time to formulate them. I didn't receive a confirmation mail that they received my application thought which has me worry a bit.

### Day 010 August 20, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Worked on Product Landing Page

**Thoughts**:
Set up the files and the user stories

**Link(s) to work**:
No links today!

### Day 009 August 19, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Worked on survey form - Reorganizing HTML and started styling

**Thoughts**:
Completed the survey form project with HTML, CSS.

### Day 008 August 18, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Worked on 5 - Array and simple queries
2. [fCC] Worked on survey form - Reorganizing HTML and started styling

**Thoughts**:
Hit a wall on the JS prep challenge. It is better to do it with a better knowledge of data structures. From my searches on the internet, the solution uses a treap (binary tree and heaps mix?) to solve the timeout issue. Otherwise the algorithm I wrote seems to do the work for 17 out of 28 tests.

No links today!

### Day 007 August 17, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Worked on survey form - passing the tests

**Thoughts**:
I am passing the tests for the fCC survey form project now. I am now working on the styling of the page based on "The Good Place" color and design.

### Day 006 August 16, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Worked on 5 - Array and simple queries

**Thoughts**:
Came up with a first solution for the Chingu challenge. When submitting, out of 27 test cases: Pass: 16; Fail: 1; Timeout: 8; Abort: 2.
Continued applying to a few jobs... didn't have time to work on the form

### Day 005 August 15, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Worked on 4 - Insert a Node at the Tail of a Linked List
2. [freeCodeCamp] Worked only a bit on fCC Survey form
3. [php] Watched 30 mins of php tutorial

**Thoughts**:
Finally solved the challenge. In the condition when the head wasn't null, I changed the value of head until I got to the tail. Declaring another variable to store the initial head then looping on it to get to the tail and assigning the node to it worked. I was thinking about how to "push" the node into the object when it actually just inserts the data in the object.

Didn't get much done on the fCC project as I was waiting for a call... but watched a php tutorial while waiting and also started the rework of my developer CV.

### Day 004 August 14, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Worked on 4 - Insert a Node at the Tail of a Linked List
2. [freeCodeCamp] Started working on the form project

**Thoughts**:
Worked on inserting a node into a linked list. I have trouble creating the full list, I am missing something here... Probably in the object I return from the function.

Started working on the survey form project from the fCC curriculum. I only put the different elements and ids necessary to pass the tests at the moment. Still thinking about the theme of the form.

### Day 003 August 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [freeCodeCamp] Worked 30 mins on the Flexbox challenges and CSS Grid.

**Thoughts**:
Hit the end of the Responsive Web Design section. I am thinking about making a tribute page to Jean Luc Picard with the LCARS (star trek OS) inspired by this website: http://www.lcarscom.net/. Show a loader and then show the profile of the captain as seen on [personel file in TNG](https://www.google.com/search?q=jean+luc+picard+personnel+file&hl=en&safe=off&tbm=isch&tbs=rimg:CVNy-_1zUSVjxIjjGMkipba9YzoxkXKRhFH1GHIgcyYSVYCVEWW2h-yNZHlfg2vUC7Eo7Qi6tRvyjxBihRkGyMYUOYSoSCcYySKltr1jOEQI_1jU4F6ngxKhIJjGRcpGEUfUYRSLNdl2KgrhEqEgkciBzJhJVgJRG1k5m0C3tf1SoSCURZbaH7I1keEdcHWNAhNdORKhIJV-Da9QLsSjsRNDmkQdDJx04qEglCLq1G_1KPEGBHqWguViTz0tioSCaFGQbIxhQ5hEdcHWNAhNdOR&tbo=u&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwisirn01-jcAhUJZt4KHeMFDfwQ9C96BAgBEBs&biw=1707&bih=852&dpr=1.13)

### Day 002: August 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Completed 3 - Print the Elements of a Linked List
2. [freeCodeCamp] Worked 30 mins on the Applied Accessibility, responsive Web Design Principles and CSS Flexbox section

**Thoughts**
Today's JS prep challenge was easy considering I have encountered linkedlist in CS50 last year in C. In JS, two class are declared as constant to create the Singly Linked List and the Linked List's nodes. The node object has two values: data and next, data containing the data and next the next node object (and its own nodes). The list object also has two values: head and tail and a method insertNode. The insertNode initialize the list with the first nodeData then sets the tail value to the node.

The responsive we design principles was quick and felt a bit weak in the content. Started CSS flexbox, it is a good way of reviewing that.

### Day 001: August 11, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [JavaScript Prep] Working on 2D Array - DS
2. [freeCodeCamp] Worked 30 mins on the Applied Accessibility section

**Thoughts**
What is the *2D Array - DS* about? The challenge is about calculating the highest score of a pattern (an hourglass) from a square grid of 6x6 values. I originally used a variable to store the highest value but it didn't pass two tests. I changed it to store each calculated value to an array and then finally return the result. The result was written using a spread operator with the array as the argument of the Math.max() function. This change allowed the code to pass all the tests.    

fCC's applied accessibility section:
 - Learned about the importance of semantic HTML
 - Learned about the difference between article (self-contained independent content), section (related content) and div (group content)
 - Time standardization with `<date></date>`
 - Audio and form accessibility

[Example]
### Day 000: January 28, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Started Pomodoro project
2. [Portfolio] Contact form, languages and scrollspy

**Thoughts**
[fCC] 
- Started pomodoro project
- Manage length of session and break
- Countdown functionality started

[Portfolio]
- Made the contact form work with formspree. Since the submit form was outside the form element, I had to add a JS code to perform the submit on click.
- Translated the portfolio to French and Japanese
- Added a scrollspy functionality when clicking on an internal link or scrolling the page.
