# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 11, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the lesson 8 Creating Lists and part of Lesson 9 Adding Media of the "Learn to Code HTML & CSS".

**Thoughts** It is great to measure the time spent on something by limiting it. I am still pretty tired from the work and lack of sleep.

### Day 2: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Missing letters". Finished Lesson 9 Adding Media and started Lesson 10 Forms of the "Lean to Code HTML & CSS" course.

**Thoughts** Pretty tired, I feel I was not going as quick as I usually do through the lessons.
