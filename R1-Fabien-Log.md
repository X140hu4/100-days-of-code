# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 11, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

### Day 1: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the lesson 8 Creating Lists and part of Lesson 9 Adding Media of the "Learn to Code HTML & CSS".

**Thoughts** It is great to measure the time spent on something by limiting it. I am still pretty tired from the work and lack of sleep.

### Day 2: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Missing letters". Finished Lesson 9 Adding Media and started Lesson 10 Forms of the "Lean to Code HTML & CSS" course.

**Thoughts** Pretty tired, I feel I was not going as quick as I usually do through the lessons.

2. [Forms - Multiple Choice Inputs] (http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-forms/#multple-choice-inputs)

### Day 3: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Boo Who". Finished Lesson 9 Adding Media and started Lesson 10 Forms of the "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" course.

**Thoughts** Today's algorithm was very easy. only using "return typeof bool === "boolean";" to identify if the element is a boolean primitive. Finished Lesson 10 Building forms and finished up to point 5 of the exercises of Lesson 11 organizing data with tables. Thinking I should start playing with HTML and CSS without any javascript for the portfolio.

### Day 4: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Sorted Union" and "Convert HTML Entities". Completed the "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" course.

**Thoughts** Lots of work today! Tomorrow needs to start with trying to build the webpage and/or start the cs50 course!

4. [Writing your best code] (http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)

### Day 5: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started CS50x on Edx.

**Thoughts** Started CS50x at last with EDx. Thinking about what to do as a project with Scratch for pset0.

### Day 6: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Spinal Tap Case". Started pset0, project with Scratch.

**Thoughts** Decided to build a Simon's game for the pset0, it will be useful to work out the game mechanics for the future FCC project. The buttons are done, need to work on the game mechanics.

### Day 7: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Sum all odd Fibonacci Numbers". Thinking about Simon's game mechanics.

**Thoughts** The game mechanics are almost written. Today's algorithm challenge was pretty challenging. The original solution was a little ugly but worked.

### Day 8: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Sum All Primes". Started building Simon's game mechanics in Scratch.

**Thoughts** I had to look around to solve the sum all primes challenge. It was pretty hard but solving it was interesting. After looking at other simon's game code in Scratch I got the hang of how to start writing my own mechanics.
