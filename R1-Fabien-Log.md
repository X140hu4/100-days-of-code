# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 11, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

### Day 1: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the lesson 8 Creating Lists and part of Lesson 9 Adding Media of the "Learn to Code HTML & CSS".

**Thoughts** It is great to measure the time spent on something by limiting it. I am still pretty tired from the work and lack of sleep.

### Day 2: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Missing letters". Finished Lesson 9 Adding Media and started Lesson 10 Forms of the "Lean to Code HTML & CSS" course.

**Thoughts** Pretty tired, I feel I was not going as quick as I usually do through the lessons.

### Day 3: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Boo Who". Finished Lesson 9 Adding Media and started Lesson 10 Forms of the "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" course.

**Thoughts** Today's algorithm was very easy. only using "return typeof bool === "boolean";" to identify if the element is a boolean primitive. Finished Lesson 10 Building forms and finished up to point 5 of the exercises of Lesson 11 organizing data with tables. Thinking I should start playing with HTML and CSS without any javascript for the portfolio.

### Day 6: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Spinal Tap Case". Started pset0, project with Scratch.

**Thoughts** Decided to build a Simon's game for the pset0, it will be useful to work out the game mechanics for the future FCC project. The buttons are done, need to work on the game mechanics.

### Day 7: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Sum all odd Fibonacci Numbers". Thinking about Simon's game mechanics.

**Thoughts** The game mechanics are almost written. Today's algorithm challenge was pretty challenging. The original solution was a little ugly but worked.

### Day 8: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Sum All Primes". Started building Simon's game mechanics in Scratch.

**Thoughts** I had to look around to solve the sum all primes challenge. It was pretty hard but solving it was interesting. After looking at other simon's game code in Scratch I got the hang of how to start writing my own mechanics.

1. [FCC] Worked on intermediate algorithm challenge "Smallest Common Multiple".
2. [CS50x] Watched about 1 hour of CS50x week 1 class.
3. [CS50x] Worked on Simon's game mechanics in scratch. Built the randomization of button, answer, check between game sequence and player sequence.

**Thoughts** The FCC challenge on Smallest Common Multiple is pretty tough. I will continue tomorrow on it. The CS50x W01 class is pretty interesting and I am making pretty good progress on the pset0, albeit I had to peek into someone else's solution I try to work the programing by myself.

1. [CS50x] Finished watching the additional videos for w1 and w2. Completed 1/3 of pset2 (1h30). Started watching w3.
2. [FCC] Completed "Binary agent"

**Thoughts** CS50x is starting to get pretty tough. I spent one hour and some googling to figure out how to tokenize the string provided in argument. The first problem of pset2 was receiving a string with names and spaces in input and giving the initials capitalized in output.

1. [CS50x] Watched a few videos of w3
2. [FCC] Completed "Everything Be True"
3. [p1xt] Started translating the resume template to HTML & CSS

**Thoughts** CS50x gets to more interesting things like sorting algorithm. Loving it :) FCC's challenge on truthy did not feel hard but I got a pretty compact code to solve it.

### Day 21: October 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Completed "Symmetric Difference"
2. [P1xt] Continued working on the clone portfolio

**Thoughts**  The FCC challenge was interesting for the maths and the logics. I started implementing a vanilla css grid for the cloning exercise.

### Day 22: October 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Started working on "Exact Change"
2. [P1xt] Continued working on the clone portfolio

**Thoughts**  The exact change has an issue with the float point. the remaining change would be less some thousandth value. (0.00958 instead of 0.01). Finished the navbar for the clones

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Completed "Exact Change"
2. [P1xt] Continued working on the clone portfolio
3. [CS50x] Started working on pset3

**Thoughts**  Worked around the float issue by using the toFixed(2) to have only two decimals. The solution provided in hint used another way to ensure the preciseness of the float by dividing by 100 the rounded number of the value multiplied by 100 => [Math.round(value*100)/100;]
Started working on pset3, in face to the difficulty, the number of information provided and the need to watch the additional video, I decided to mostly work on them on the week ends in order to allow more time for thoughts.

### Day 31: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Completed "No Repeats Please"
2. [FCC] Project: Portfolio 4 pomodoros (2hrs)

**Thoughts** Completed the algorithm, there was an issue with my regexp test. It would return true when actually false, taking away the g element solved the problem but a better implementation of the regexp here for repeating characters is: /(.)\1+/g instead of building it from the str passed in argument. Spent two hours to work on the portfolio challenge.

2. [CS50x] Completed Resize (less) (6.25 pomodori)
3. [CS50x] Started Recover (5 pomodori)

**Thoughts** Worked through the different problem sets. They are pretty challenging because of the concept of pointers. Tried to do the more version of Resize after completing the more, abandoned doing it but hope to come back to it in the future.

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Completed Recover (2.5 pomodori - tot 7.5)
2. [FCC] Completed "Make a Person"
3. [FCC] Worked a little bit on FCC's portfolio

**Thoughts** Finished pset4 at last. Had some issues with the while loop, the fread would not evaluate when being in the condition, used a do {} while (!feof(file)); loop to end of file to generate the jpg and had to insert a break for when the fread is not 512bytes. This had cause problems with the last file having a bunch of zeroes at the end of the file, which does not prevent the image to being viewable but makes it slightly heavier and not correct.
FCC "make a person" was relatively easy to complete. It was interesting to see how "this" worked

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Completed "Map the Debris" (1p)
2. [FCC] Worked on FCC portfolio (2p)
3. [CS50x] Continued watching videos from w04 and a little bit of w05 course.

**Thoughts**
Got around the FCC challenge pretty quickly.
Struggled much with the vertical alignment for the aboutsection of the portfolio. Finally decided to calculate the middle of the element and its position relative to the image and use margin-top to align.

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Worked on FCC portfolio (5p)
2. [CS50x] Continued watching w05 course
3. [FCC] Started setting up HTML and CSS for Random Quote Machine project. (1p)

**Thoughts**
Finally finished the portfolio. The code is not as clean and pretty as I would like but it is a good beginning imho. I will do better for the actual portfolio I want to use but currently the focus is to go through the projects with the MED (minimum effective dose).
In the CS50x w05 course, David talks about the linked lists using pointers and how to manipulate them. He also introduced the concept of LIFO and FIFO for queues.
Started setting up HTML and CSS for the Random quote machine project. Probably need to refresh the lessons previous to the challenge in order to complete it.

2. [FCC] Reviewed "JSON APIs and AJAX" on FCC
3. [FCC] Working on Random Quote Machine project (5p)

**Thoughts**
3/4 of the CS50x w05 course. David talked about building struct for building nodes, creating binary trees and searching through them. Looks pretty powerful.
Reviewed "SON APIs and AJAX", need to dig deeper in order to complete the Random quote project.

2. [FCC] Completed Random Quote Machine project (3p - tot 4h10)
3. [FCC] Started working on the Local Weather project (3p)

**Thoughts**
Almost finished CS50x w05 course.
Finished the random quote machine project. Chose to write the JS in vanilla JS and manipulate the elements directly, googling solutions to specific functions and arrays, then adapting them to my environment.
Had some initial issues with setting up the local weather's API connection. My request to the API was outside the function that got the position so there was some timing issues.
