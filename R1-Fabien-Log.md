# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 11, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

### Day 1: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the lesson 8 Creating Lists and part of Lesson 9 Adding Media of the "Learn to Code HTML & CSS".

**Thoughts** It is great to measure the time spent on something by limiting it. I am still pretty tired from the work and lack of sleep.

### Day 2: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Missing letters". Finished Lesson 9 Adding Media and started Lesson 10 Forms of the "Lean to Code HTML & CSS" course.

**Thoughts** Pretty tired, I feel I was not going as quick as I usually do through the lessons.

### Day 3: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Boo Who". Finished Lesson 9 Adding Media and started Lesson 10 Forms of the "Learn to Code HTML & CSS" course.

**Thoughts** Today's algorithm was very easy. only using "return typeof bool === "boolean";" to identify if the element is a boolean primitive. Finished Lesson 10 Building forms and finished up to point 5 of the exercises of Lesson 11 organizing data with tables. Thinking I should start playing with HTML and CSS without any javascript for the portfolio.

### Day 6: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Spinal Tap Case". Started pset0, project with Scratch.

**Thoughts** Decided to build a Simon's game for the pset0, it will be useful to work out the game mechanics for the future FCC project. The buttons are done, need to work on the game mechanics.

### Day 7: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Sum all odd Fibonacci Numbers". Thinking about Simon's game mechanics.

**Thoughts** The game mechanics are almost written. Today's algorithm challenge was pretty challenging. The original solution was a little ugly but worked.

### Day 8: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's intermediate algorithm challenge "Sum All Primes". Started building Simon's game mechanics in Scratch.

**Thoughts** I had to look around to solve the sum all primes challenge. It was pretty hard but solving it was interesting. After looking at other simon's game code in Scratch I got the hang of how to start writing my own mechanics.

### Day 8: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Worked on intermediate algorithm challenge "Smallest Common Multiple".
2. [CS50x] Watched about 1 hour of CS50x week 1 class.
3. [CS50x] Worked on Simon's game mechanics in scratch. Built the randomization of button, answer, check between game sequence and player sequence.

**Thoughts** The FCC challenge on Smallest Common Multiple is pretty tough. I will continue tomorrow on it. The CS50x W01 class is pretty interesting and I am making pretty good progress on the pset0, albeit I had to peek into someone else's solution I try to work the programing by myself.

2. [CS50x] Finished watching the w01 class.
3. [CS50x] Project almost over, started simplifying the code by breaking it down into smaller functions.

2. [FCC] Completed "Binary agent"

**Thoughts** CS50x is starting to get pretty tough. I spent one hour and some googling to figure out how to tokenize the string provided in argument. The first problem of pset2 was receiving a string with names and spaces in input and giving the initials capitalized in output.

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Completed "Symmetric Difference"
2. [P1xt] Continued working on the clone portfolio

**Thoughts**  The FCC challenge was interesting for the maths and the logics. I started implementing a vanilla css grid for the cloning exercise.

### Day 22: October 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Started working on "Exact Change"
2. [P1xt] Continued working on the clone portfolio

**Thoughts**  The exact change has an issue with the float point. the remaining change would be less some thousandth value. (0.00958 instead of 0.01). Finished the navbar for the clones

### Day 23: October 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Completed "Exact Change"
2. [P1xt] Continued working on the clone portfolio
3. [CS50x] Started working on pset3

**Thoughts**  Worked around the float issue by using the toFixed(2) to have only two decimals. The solution provided in hint used another way to ensure the preciseness of the float by dividing by 100 the rounded number of the value multiplied by 100 => [Math.round(value*100)/100;]
Started working on pset3, in face to the difficulty, the number of information provided and the need to watch the additional video, I decided to mostly work on them on the week ends in order to allow more time for thoughts.

### Day 24: October 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
