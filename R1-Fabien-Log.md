### Day 68: November 20, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Continued reading through pset8's documentation (2p)
2. [CS50x] Started watching week 11 contents

**Thoughts**
There is a lot of things but nothing too complicated for Google API's.
I will try to use jQuery instead of using pure JS, as I have done so far.
There are a lot of videos for week 11 for the Final project.

### Day 67: November 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Started pset8 - Mashup (4p)

**Thoughts**
Mashup is:
There is a lot of documentation to read before starting to code anything. I started reading through and taking notes about the Google Maps Javascript API.
Read introduction, markups and started info windows.

### Day 66: November 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Completed pset7 (2p)

**Thoughts**
Very cool pset. Completed password change and added messages "flash" to provide feedback to user (transaction completed, password change successful, etc.)

### Day 65: November 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Correction of index.html
2. [CS50x] Implemented history
3. [CS50x] Started implementing password change

**Thoughts**
Corrected average price calculation for index.html. Implementation of history was pretty easy, based on index's table and queries. Started implementing password change. Noticed I can send a notification to the layout, I will use next session to figure out how to do it and implement it.

### Day 64: November 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Implemented sell (3p)

**Thoughts**
Completed the implementation of sell. Issue with the sums and values returned for index.

### Day 63: November 15, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Completed implementation of index (3p)

**Thoughts**
Instead of using the usd function from helper.py, I format it directly in the flask html. Styling took some time, and felt like I cheated for the total row by having a first td element span 4 columns.

### Day 62: November 14, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [MongoDB] Week 2 of mongoDB basics
2. [CS50x] Continued working on C$50 Finance (1p)

**Thoughts**
 Started 2nd week but being very long and being late... There are a lot of things that do not work in the course :/ It looks pretty similar to SQL anyway so having experience with it and using it for CS50x I can pick it up later. Most of the course was spent installing their softwares, creating accounts on supporting webapps...
 CS50x : Managed to get a new column with the product of shares and price. However the total is not correct...

### Day 61: November 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Continued working on C$50 Finance (3p)

**Thoughts**
Implemented buy. Needed to convert some numbers to float and precisely select cash in the list returned by the SQL select to make the comparison. Started implementing the index page, stopped at building the SQL select to get values and calculate the total on the fly.

### Day 60: November 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Continued working on C$50 Finance (4p)

**Thoughts**
Got more comfortable with the interactions between python, flask, sql and html. Finished implementing register, quote. Started implementing buy, which needs to interact more with the SQL database.

### Day 59: November 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Started working on C$50 Finance (3p)
2. [fCC - Twitch TV] Figured why only last API request was completed (2p)

**Thoughts**
CS50 Finance has some documentation but not too much. The challenge is to work with python, flask, sql and html at the same time to provide a web app.
The problem with the fCC API request was that I had the xhr request outside of the loop that made the request. The code made a request on the same object each time. The problem was solved by moving the new xhr creation in the loop so that it creates a different xhr object for each iteration.

### Day 58: November 10, 2017
**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC - Twitch TV] Got JSON back but issue with loop through channels (1p)


**Thoughts**
From the fCC project, I get only the last channel's data. Send a message on the gitter chat to get some help.

### Day 57: November 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Finished watching week 9 course and started watching the additional videos
2. [fCC] Starting fCC Twitch viewer project (2p)

**Thoughts**
Struggling with the Twitch API... The link is correct and return the JSON in the browser but returns errors when using it in the JS.

### Day 56: November 08, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Watched week9 (40mins)
2. [fCC] Completed Wikipedia Viewer (1p - 4h10)

**Thoughts**
This week's CS50 course has a lot of new things packed into it. It is a little confusing with the flask server side syntax.

### Day 55: November 07, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Watched week9 (40mins)
2. [MongoDB] Finished week 1 (1h)

**Thoughts**
Watched CS50x videos.
MongoDB was interesting but the version that was available was very buggy. I had to reload the whole app to analyze a new datasets. I had to reinstall it because of some JS error. Then the map did not show properly on the last lab...
I noticed there was a new version on the mongoDB website.

### Day 54: November 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Started watching w09 course on SQL (30mins)
2. [JS30] Watched 01 - Javascript drumkit (20mins)
3. [fCC - Wikipedia Viewer] Managed to output values to DOM from the API query response. (1h15mins)
4. [MongoDB] Started first few videos (10mins)

**Thoughts**
CS50 course is not too bad, there is a lot of supporting videos so I will need to watch a lot of them by the end of the week.
JS30 is pretty interesting. I will try to do at least 3 per week. Watch then do.
As always, pretty hard to find how to do things without frameworks in JS. Using the keywords pure JS instead of vanilla JS gives more results. The performance are much better apparently but harder to code and maintain, so the use of pure or framework will depend of the size of a project I imagine.
I forgot I subscribed to the mongoDB university's introductory course. Downloaded the app and it is pretty neat, I can download the videos there and have the quizzes.

### Day 53: November 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC - Wikipedia Viewer] Random quote link and learning about wikipedia API  (1h40mins)

**Thoughts**
The documentation for the wiki API is hard to understand and there is a lot of parameters.

### Day 52: November 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Finished sentiments (tot: 2h52)
2. [PH Project] Started working on a new PH website (7p)

**Thoughts**
Sentiments took some time to complete but was interesting and very cool to work on.
Started to work on a new website for peace house. Started making a page about suzunami to present to Yumiko.

### Day 51: November 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Finished credit.py (36min - tot 1h01), Finished Vigenere.py (49mins), started Sentiments.

**Thoughts**
Going through the pset6, getting used to Python syntax and logics. Sentiments has a lot of documentation to read an watch before being able to do implement anything. The implementation looks pretty cool.

### Day 50: November 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CSS Challenge] Completed #001 Tile, started #002 Menu (4p)
2. [CS50x] Finished Mario.py, started Credit.py (tot 3 problems)


**Thoughts**
CSS Challenge is nice to explore more CSS manipulation. Tile was good to review what I learned from the introduction to pure css image course. The menu challenge is challenging for interaction with the css and animation.
Started writing python programs based on the previous psets. Mario was pretty straightforward and is much smaller than the C equivalent. Credit is a little bit more complicated because I used switch statement that do not exist in Python. Tried running the code, started debugging with prints in order to determine where the problems are arising.

### Day 49: November 01, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CSS Challenge] Set up and start with #001 Tile (1p)
2. [fCC - Wikipedia viewer] Read documentation and start coding.
3. [CS50x] Finished watching w08 Python
4. [CSS Dinner] Review CSS
5. [Reading]

**Thoughts**
Started P1xt suck less november challenge.
Started reading the wikipedia API's documentation. It does not seem too difficult. The difficult part will be the dynamic parts of the page.
Python has a very different syntax from C and Javascript, I wonder how much getting used to it will need to re-implement the programs of the first psets.
CSS Dinner was a good review of CSS selectors.
Did a lot of reading about design, CSS layout.

### Day 48: October 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Completed fCC Local Weather (1p - tot: 4h30)


**Thoughts**
Completed the fCC Local Weather project ! Had an issue when trying to change the temperature. The formula was not right, when the temperature was in Fahrenheit it would correctly substract 32 but wrongly multiply by 9/5 instead of 5/9.

### Day 48: October 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [Coding Artist] Completed Introduction to Pure CSS Images
2. [fCC] Worked on fCC Local Weather (1p)
3. [CS50x] Continued watching w08 Python.


**Thoughts**
Jumped to October 30. October 29 was spent at Universal Studio Japan, not much time after getting back to work on coding :( The day was fun though ^^.
Started a course on Pure CSS Images as part of [Prep for “Suck less at CSS” November](https://medium.com/p1xts-blog/mini-challenge-prep-for-suck-less-at-css-november-b04b30799ef6) by P1xt.

### Day 47: October 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Worked on fCC Local Weather (1p)
2. [CS50x] Started watching w08 Python.

**Thoughts**
Pretty busy day, could not squeeze much work but watched the videos w06-07 on HTML&CSS and Machine Learning during the week and started watching w08 on Python.
The weather API create several objects in the main object's array depending on the weather, there should be a logic to check how many there are and check for the existence of the proeprty "icon".

### Day 46: October 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [fCC] Worked on fCC Local Weather (3p)

**Thoughts**
The date responseText returned by the request could be printed in the innerHTML. However I could not access the values inside, the solution was to use `var data = JSON.parse(reqResponse);` in order to turn the response into a JS object which can be accessed.
Decided to implement a MED version of the project.

### Day 45: October 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. Completed CSS Grid Garden (1p - 25 mins)
2. Completed CSS Flexbox Froggy (7/8p - 23mins)

**Thoughts**
Both tutorials CSS Grid and Flexbox were good and more challenging as the tutorials progress. Next interesting tutorial would be [Flexbox zombie](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/enrolled/139425).

### Day 44: October 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Finished working on pset5.

**Thoughts**
PSET5 was very difficult. It seems the memoery leak came from places I would declare a node* currNode = root and node* root = malloc(sizeof(node)). Looking at other people's problems, I changed the currNode and root to be global and have the memory allocation done in the function (they can not be allocated outside a function).
Then had an issue with handling long words, had to add a length condition in the check function.

1. [CS50x] Finished watching w05 course - started pset5 (2p)

**Thoughts**
There is only one problem in this week's pset. It looks simple at the moment. Let's see how it goes. Reading through the explanation took some time. Currently answering the questions.

### Day 39: October 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Continued watching w05 course
2. [FCC] Completed Random Quote Machine project (3p - tot 4h10)
3. [FCC] Started working on the Local Weather project (3p)

**Thoughts**
Almost finished CS50x w05 course.
Finished the random quote machine project. Chose to write the JS in vanilla JS and manipulate the elements directly, googling solutions to specific functions and arrays, then adapting them to my environment.
Had some initial issues with setting up the local weather's API connection. My request to the API was outside the function that got the position so there was some timing issues.

### Day 38: October 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Continued watching w05 course
2. [FCC] Reviewed "JSON APIs and AJAX" on FCC
3. [FCC] Working on Random Quote Machine project (5p)

**Thoughts**
3/4 of the CS50x w05 course. David talked about building struct for building nodes, creating binary trees and searching through them. Looks pretty powerful.
Reviewed "SON APIs and AJAX", need to dig deeper in order to complete the Random quote project.

### Day 37: October 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Worked on FCC portfolio (5p)
2. [CS50x] Continued watching w05 course
3. [FCC] Started setting up HTML and CSS for Random Quote Machine project. (1p)

**Thoughts**
Finally finished the portfolio. The code is not as clean and pretty as I would like but it is a good beginning imho. I will do better for the actual portfolio I want to use but currently the focus is to go through the projects with the MED (minimum effective dose).
In the CS50x w05 course, David talks about the linked lists using pointers and how to manipulate them. He also introduced the concept of LIFO and FIFO for queues.
Started setting up HTML and CSS for the Random quote machine project. Probably need to refresh the lessons previous to the challenge in order to complete it.

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Completed "Map the Debris" (1p)
2. [FCC] Worked on FCC portfolio (2p)
3. [CS50x] Continued watching videos from w04 and a little bit of w05 course.

**Thoughts**
Got around the FCC challenge pretty quickly.
Struggled much with the vertical alignment for the aboutsection of the portfolio. Finally decided to calculate the middle of the element and its position relative to the image and use margin-top to align.

### Day 35: October 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [CS50x] Completed Recover (2.5 pomodori - tot 7.5)
2. [FCC] Completed "Make a Person"
3. [FCC] Worked a little bit on FCC's portfolio

**Thoughts** Finished pset4 at last. Had some issues with the while loop, the fread would not evaluate when being in the condition, used a do {} while (!feof(file)); loop to end of file to generate the jpg and had to insert a break for when the fread is not 512bytes. This had cause problems with the last file having a bunch of zeroes at the end of the file, which does not prevent the image to being viewable but makes it slightly heavier and not correct.
FCC "make a person" was relatively easy to complete. It was interesting to see how "this" worked

2. [CS50x] Completed Resize (less) (6.25 pomodori)
3. [CS50x] Started Recover (5 pomodori)

**Thoughts** Worked through the different problem sets. They are pretty challenging because of the concept of pointers. Tried to do the more version of Resize after completing the more, abandoned doing it but hope to come back to it in the future.

1. [FCC] Project: Portfolio 2 pomodoro
2. Reading about Grid and flexbox
3. [CS50x] Finished the course video, half way through additional videos

**Thoughts** Had only time to work on the portfolio at lunch break and read about grid and flexbox throughout the day.

### Day 31: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Completed "No Repeats Please"
2. [FCC] Project: Portfolio 4 pomodoros (2hrs)

**Thoughts** Completed the algorithm, there was an issue with my regexp test. It would return true when actually false, taking away the g element solved the problem but a better implementation of the regexp here for repeating characters is: /(.)\1+/g instead of building it from the str passed in argument. Spent two hours to work on the portfolio challenge.

**Today's Progress**:
1. [FCC] Completed "Exact Change"
2. [P1xt] Continued working on the clone portfolio
3. [CS50x] Started working on pset3

**Thoughts**  Worked around the float issue by using the toFixed(2) to have only two decimals. The solution provided in hint used another way to ensure the preciseness of the float by dividing by 100 the rounded number of the value multiplied by 100 => [Math.round(value*100)/100;]
Started working on pset3, in face to the difficulty, the number of information provided and the need to watch the additional video, I decided to mostly work on them on the week ends in order to allow more time for thoughts.
